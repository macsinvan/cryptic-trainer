"""
Training Handler - V2 Template-based step system

Implements hypothesis-driven solving:
1. Find definition → form hypothesis
2. Scan for common vocabulary (anchors) and indicators
3. Start with what you KNOW, discover unknowns

Each step type has a predefined template (90% generic).
Clue data provides only specific values (10%).
